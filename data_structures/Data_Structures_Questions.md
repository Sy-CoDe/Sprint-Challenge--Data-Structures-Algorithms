Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
 - __`O(log(n))`__


2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
 - __`O(n)`__

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
 - __`O(log(n))`__

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 
 - __`O(n)`__

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
 - __`O(n log(n))`__

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
 - __`O(n log(n), O(log(n))`__
